# AutoRate
When was the last time you rated a merchant for a service or product they offered? Surveys say only 10-30% of customers actually rate after buying. Manual ratings can’t be trusted! Introducing AutoRate – VISA’s automatic ratings system that suggests local stores to you based on actual spending trends of people – they buy more, more popular the store, higher the rating!  Simple. Real-time. Fast. Efficient. Trustworthy. Effortless. Let’s AutoRate!

## What does it do?
Rates local merchants based on the volume, frequency of VISA transactions in their stores.

## What's the Tech behind it?
It's a Flutter application, that uses atleast 2 RESTful APIs offered by the Visa Developer Platform. It also was envisioned to use a machine learning model that could analyze revisit trends. 

## Who are the end users?
VISA Cardholders. But the actual target customers are the Acquirers.

## How is this offered?
As a service to Acquirer banks (who will then use this to serve their clients, the cardholders) – can extend this feature to an existing app for their cardholder customers or we can provide an out-of-box app to them.

## What value is this adding to VISA?
AutoRate benefits Visa’s acquirers by providing them with more merchants looking to accept Visa, because this would make their business more visible on the app, inviting more customers. It’s a self-sustaining model. More people use AutoRate, more the businesses prefer VISA’s acquirers, more the transactions, more sales for VISA, more accurate ratings, more satisfied customers, more people use AutoRate and on and on!

## What's the novelty here?
Eliminates manual ratings – which are always bad indicators, because they’re voluntary! Majority of people don’t like giving ratings to a store unless they really want to (extremely good/extremely bad cases). Hence, the current rating system is inaccurate. This idea of ratings using transactions never been done before (to the best of our knowledge!).

## Disclaimer
This technical project was created as part of a hackathon that Visa organized when I was being onboarded. I was part of a team of 5 new joinees. This app is a prototype that had to be showcased within two weeks. The idea was among the top 3 in the first round of our class.
